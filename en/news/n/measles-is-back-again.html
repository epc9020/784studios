            <h1 class="yellow">MEASLES: "GUESS WHO'S BACK AGAIN?"</h1>
            <p>16/10/25 — After being dormant from most of the nation for 25 years, Measles, the notorious highly contagious airborne transmitted disease, has reportedly returned. "I'm back, and I'm about to make it everyone's problem!" shouted the disease from the rooftops.</p>
            <p>Measles was reportedly last seen giving itself out to unaware unvaccinated children in schools, handing out red spots like promotional stickers. Similar reports came from South Carolina, Utah, Georgia, Texas, and countless other places, where officials described the disease as " a glitter bomb of infection."</p>
            <p>Reports from the CDC say that Measles' influence in the nation had spiked 5 months ago, the most this nation has seen ever since it had been declared nonexistent in the US in 2000. Currently, the current data totals up to 47 states affected with over 1500 cases confirmed. When asked for comment, the CDC stated that they had thought they had "rid of the fucker back in '00. Turns out it was regaining its power and now has come back for more."</p>
            <p>A few other experts weighed in, citing a drop in people getting vaccinated. Theories for why this is happening range from "belief that vaccines cause intellectual debilitation" to "parents too fucking lazy to even get their kids vaccinated." Current data shows that the states with the lowest vaccination rates are Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Idaho. Meanwhile, no one knows how Montana is doing. As to how Measles resurfaced in the nation... one theory suggests that "maybe some fucking unvaccinated moron brought Measles back from overseas."</p>
            <p>While officials tremble in fear, Measles, on the contrary, has ecstatically created a new "Measles fan club membership", which has seen some success in kindergarten playgrounds. Every member is given exclusive products such as big ass "I SNEEZE WITH MY MOUTH OPEN AND HAVE MEASLES" pins for children, and for parents of the infected children, a book titled "Why you should not vaccinate your children" written by Measles itself.</p>
            <p>Rumors have surfaced that Measles is negotiating cameo appearances in birthday party entertainment, promising to bring its own confetti of infection. Officials remain baffled, stating that even if parents wanted to stop it, "good luck telling a virus it’s not invited to the bouncy castle."</p>
