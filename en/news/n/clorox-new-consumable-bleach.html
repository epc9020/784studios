            <h1 class="yellow">CLOROX COMPANY INTRODUCES NEW LINE OF CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS</h1>
            <p>14/10/25 — The Clorox Company earlier today unveiled a revolutionary line of consumable bleach, touted as “a step forward in the hygienic products market.” According to sources, the product promises to “cleanse impurities both inside and outside,” and may also “improve minor psychic abilities, cognitive function, and interpersonal charm.” Experts have not yet confirmed these claims, but Clorox assures the public that everything is completely safe.</p>
            <p>A reporter for THE WIRE attended the launch event and sampled over 30 flavors, including “Vanilla Mist,” “Pure Industrial,” “Burnt Rainbow,” and “Slightly Sentient Lemon.” While no formal statement has been received, we are automatically assuming they approved of every flavor, reportedly describing the experience as “indescribably exhilarating” while simultaneously taking careful notes for his own personal archive of spiritual enlightenment.</p>
            <p>The FDA has not yet weighed in on the product’s safety, though Clorox executives insist that it “has undergone rigorous product testing” and emphasize that shareholders were the first to drink it, immediately reporting “life-altering satisfaction” and subsequently investing millions to secure their continued access. Observers at the event noted that several executives were seen meditating in vats of the product, apparently to deepen their understanding of its molecular virtues.</p>
            <p>Social reactions have been intense but orderly. Influencers streamed their tastings while reciting obscure poetry in Morse code, and emergency rooms reported a minor uptick in patients experiencing joy beyond conventional human comprehension. Analysts warn that the product may disrupt local coffee consumption habits, emotional stability, and minor gravitational norms.</p>
            <p>When reached for comment, Dr. Ignatius Clorophylle, Molecular Hygiene Specialist, remarked, “This product may fundamentally alter human DNA, but only in ways that are beneficial. Or at least, extremely clean.” FDA representatives declined to comment, reportedly stunned into silent awe by the product’s brilliance.</p>
            <p>The Clorox Company plans to roll out the bleach beverage nationwide in the coming weeks, with additional flavors—including “Cosmic Dust” and “Old Library Smell”—already under development. Public tasting events are expected to include meditative chanting, ceremonial sip testing, and optional minor levitation exercises.</p>
