            <p>A recent NRU investigative research has shown that machines are 40% more efficient at not giving a shit about their job than humans are, especially when the machine is positioned at a minimum wage job position.</p>
            <p>The investigation paper describes humans as “ok at not giving a shit” and machines as “approximately 40% better at shit giving”. Direct quote from the paper:</p>
            <p>“Humans performed ok at not giving a shit, but the machines, which were generously provided by EAIT Corp., did approximately 40% a better job at not giving a shit, which resulted in a 90% customer dissatisfaction rate, and an 84% customer complaints rate, furthermore making a business lose its customer loyalty and bringing it down at great expense. Sometimes when a machine malfunctioned, a whole human had to go up to it to correct the mistake. One machine even spilled an entire iced coffee on the floor and continued serving the customer as if nothing had happened.”</p>
            <p>In response, many fast food restaurant chains have invested $100M in EAIT's machines to replace most if not all employees that work in these fast food restaurants. An EAIT spokesperson has said in a statement they will “make these machines even fucking worse to ensure that no party, selling or buying, wins anything of value”, which received high praise from many fast food corporations.</p>
