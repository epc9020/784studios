<h1 class="yellow">SOME GUY TO USE NUCLEAR BOMBS AS FIREWORKS THIS NEW YEAR</h1>
<p>Reports indicate that a man identified as Hal Calhaun is planning to repurpose several actual nuclear bombs stored in his basement into fireworks for the upcoming New Year's celebration.</p>

<p class="cyan">"This year, I don't just want to use any firework," Hal explained confidently. "This year I want to be the one guy on the block with the biggest, baddest, most kick-ass firework ever launched in human history."</p>

<p class="cyan">The "firework" in question: a Mark 17 nuclear bomb, designed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1954. Only about 200 MK-17s were ever built. Hal possesses five of them because, according to him, "some previous homeowner must've left them behind or whatever."</p>

<p class="cyan">Originally designed to be dropped from a Convair B-36 'Peacemaker'—an aircraft Hal does not own—he has instead mounted the bombs onto several rocket engines he does inexplicably own.</p>

<p class="cyan">"What I did was just attach the bombs to these rockets I conveniently had laying around," Hal said, gesturing to the improvised launch platform. "I also strapped a couple hundred normal fireworks to the sides, like backup dancers. For flair."</p>

<p class="cyan">When asked about the detonation issue, Hal was ready. "Now you might say, 'Hal, aren't these things designed to explode on impact with the ground?' And yes, absolutely. That's why I modified them to explode remotely!" Hal added, proudly displaying a homemade remote detonator built from what appeared to be a garage-door opener and duct tape. "Trust me, I know what I'm doing—my father was a nuclear engineer. Or so I heard."</p>

<p class="cyan">At press time, Hal prematurely launched one of the armed nuclear "fireworks." Police responded immediately, charging him with unlawful noise and issuing a $700 fine. Officials added that "further charges may be pending, depending on whether or not that thing lands somewhere."</p>
