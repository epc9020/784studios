<h1 class="yellow">YOUR ELECTRICITY BILL TO BE DECIDED IN A GAME OF ROULETTE</h1>
<p>LUMA Energy this prior week stated that they are implementing a new billing system that decides your bill based on the results of a game of roulette.</p>

<p class="cyan">(Transcribed from Spanish) “It’s never been a good time for our customers, as if you’re lucky enough, you probably wont have to pay any amount of money this month!” said the president of LUMA.</p>

<p class="cyan">Each customer’s residency gets assigned a random color and number between 0 and 36, with the addition of a “bonus multiplier.” LUMA states that bills can range from “free energy this month” to “you’ll have to file for bankruptcy for this one.”</p>

<p class="cyan">When asked how the bonus multiplier is calculated, LUMA representatives said the formula is “too complex for the public to understand,” but confirmed that one multiplier tier is literally called “El Coquí Fatal,” which instantly triples your bill for “auditory environmental reasons.”</p>

<p class="cyan">In test runs of the system, participants were gathered at a recently closed down casino, which was known to have electrical wiring held together with duct tape and faith. Upon turning on the lights, a transformer had blown, which in classic fashion triggered a city-wide outage within seconds.</p>

<p class="cyan">The Government of Puerto Rico has reportedly asked LUMA to reconsider the system, to which LUMA responded by spinning a small handheld roulette wheel and saying, “If it lands on red, we think about it.”</p>
