<h1>What is SIT (Swatch Internet Time)?</h1>
<p>Swatch Internet Time, normally refered to as .beat time, is a different way of timekeeping on the internet. Instead of multiple timezones and 24 hours, .beat time unifies the time into one (UTC -0100) and divides the day into 1000 decimals, or beats. This is useful on the internet, where timezones can cause confusion to users worldwide and make this site more complex than it already is, .beat time allows us to state just one time for everyone to refer to, as seen on the frontpage. <br><br>On 784studios.net, .beat time can be seen though all pages (on desktop, in the top left corner of the INFOTICK service indicator, which switches between .beat time, then your local time, then the current date. On mobile, at the begining of the ticker, beginning with .beat time first, then your local time.)<br><br>On the internet, there are useful tools that can help you make sense of .beat time, which we have linked below.</p>
