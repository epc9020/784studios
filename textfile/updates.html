<span class="teletext5">The machine we use to digitize tapes for online release is out of service. Unfortunately 784 Studios does not have enough funding to do any repairs, so we turn to a temporary capture solution we call DELLsperation. (the damage is s fried mobo, we only have a dell usb tv tuner)</span>
